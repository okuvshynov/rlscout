Next:

[ ] use model within search
[ ] cleanup, tests
[x] multitrheading self-play
[ ] examples - the one with attack/defence which works for 1M rollouts 
[ ] visualization for activations/gradients
[ ] experiment with residual net
[ ] full loop
[ ] transfer 7x7 -> 8x8
[ ] avoid sending 'handles' back, just send the state itself for state and buffer/root for mcts?
[ ] residual net
[ ] experiment on ANN -- just see what the throughput is depending on batch size
